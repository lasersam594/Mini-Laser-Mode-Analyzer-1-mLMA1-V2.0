mLMA1-V2.0 runs on an Atmega328p Nano 3.0 and provides the following functions:

1. Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (SFPI) driver output and detector input.
2. Laser power meter detector input.
3. Laser longitudinal mode plotter detector input.

These all support dual polarization inputs for two channels of display.

mLMA1 requires appropriate SFPI cavity with a low voltage PZT and detector(s).  It is otherwise stand-alone with its own color LCD.
